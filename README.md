## Description

Pierre's ... "Friend" (I think they're dating, but he doesn't want to tell me becuase he knows I'll make a big deal out of it. YOU DESERVE LOVE PIERRE.) Eau Claire has contracted us to make an MVC application for her salon! The goal here is to have a page with a database that allows her to input her currently employed stylists and their clients. This will help her keep things more organized and prevent incidents where a client comes in and can't get in because a double appointment was made or was never logged.
